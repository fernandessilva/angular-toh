<h1>Tour of Heroes</h1>


<p>
This project follows the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh">tour of heroes tutorial</a> from the Angular website. I've changed some of the features and names in order to do something fun that seems appealing to me.

The project is aimed to develop my personal, and professional, experiences towards front-end developing using Angular.
